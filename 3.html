 <p>In fact, domestication requires that a wild animal fulfill many prerequisites: the animal has to have a diet that humans can supply; a rapid growth rate; a willingness to breed in captivity; a tractable disposition; a social structure involving submissive behavior towards dominant animals and humans; and lack of a tendency to panic when fenced in. (part3, pg2). I pick this becus it a set of rule that i have never seen be for. My out side knoleg is that dag and cat are dumsicadi.
